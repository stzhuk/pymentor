# Python Mentor Roadmap (Remake)

This project is a remake of the original **Python Mentor** roadmap website.  
The original website is currently unavailable, so this project recreates the roadmap structure and content for educational purposes.

⚠️ This is **not** the original project and I am **not the author** of the original Python Mentor website.  
All credit for the roadmap concept and structure belongs to the original creators.
